The challenge most VPs face is delivering on AI promises without overwhelming existing teams or compromising quality.\n\nDevin, the AI software engineer, has rolled out in production at [Citi](https://www.americanbanker.com/news/citi-is-rolling-out-agentic-ai-to-its-40-000-developers) and [Goldman Sachs](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/11/goldman-sachs-autonomous-coder-pilot-marks-major-ai-milestone.html). On average, engineering teams see 6\u201312x efficiency gains while freeing developers for customer-facing innovation.\n\nWould you be open to coffee one morning? I promise it'll be more energizing than a New England road race.\n\nBest,\nJake"

Saw you are quite the cyclist yourself (8th-place finish in a NE road race) -- is this still something you find yourself doing? Even when traveling I try to make sure I carve out time to run/bike. \n\nI\u2019m Jake and I\u2019m a Director here at Cognition and wanted to reach out to you based on similar orgs I\u2019m meeting with to discuss AI agents for software development.
