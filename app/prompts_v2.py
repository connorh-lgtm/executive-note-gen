Hi Garima,

In your Forbes Tech Council piece, you stressed building AI ecosystems that deliver measurable outcomes. This is often something I think about when leading my teams -- how do I turn activity into value? 

Devin, the AI software engineer, helps technology teams like yours achieve, on average, 6 - 12x efficiency gains by automating high-volume engineering tasks. Already in production at Citi (American Banker: Citi Is Rolling Out Agentic AI To Its 40,000 Developers), Goldman Sachs (CNBC: Goldman Sachs is piloting its first autonomous coder in major AI milestone for Wall Street), and several of the largest financial services firms internationally, Devin accelerates key projects, while freeing talent to focus on customer innovation.  

Manulife is one of the only major insurers in NA we are not actively engaged with in some capacity.  I would like to change this :) 

Do you have any open slots later this week or early next week to connect? 

Best,
Jake

On a personal note it is great to see your work with Society for Science - I spend some of my free time being an Individual Tax Preparer for low-income households. It often just takes access to information to make all the difference.

EXAMPLE 2:
Hi Ankur,

Manulife's AI transformation across finance, actuarial, and treasury is a large initiative you are heading. The challenge, as you know, isn't just adoption of AI at scale -- it's translating that adoption into measurable enterprise value.

Devin (async cloud agent from the Cognition team) helps by automating high-volume engineering, improving efficiency on key projects 8–12x, and freeing talent for innovation. Peers like Nubank and Citi have shown how this acceleration expands capacity, and links directly to customer and financial outcomes.

Goldman Sachs calls Devin an "AI-powered software engineer" reshaping productivity. 

Would you be open to a short working session next week to walk through this?

Best,
Jake

EXAMPLE 3:
Hi Rohit,

Expense discipline (<45% by 2027) is a board mandate few global insurers set so visibly. I can imagine you and your team have massive efficiency targets to allow for time to drive innovation.

EXAMPLE 1:
Hi John,

I'm a MN native (and also fellow expat), and I'd like to extend a personal invitation to a private executive dinner in Minneapolis bringing together technology and business leaders shaping the future of AI and innovation. 

Your leadership at 3M -- scaling AI through initiatives like PIMLAD, accelerating product development with generative AI, and driving intelligent automation across global operations—has made you a voice worth listening to. What stands out even more is how you pair technological ambition with authenticity and purpose, as you shared in your ACS One-Minute Mentor piece about being "true to yourself" and creating environments where people can pursue their passions.

This dinner will be a chance to connect with peers who are facing the same questions you are -- how to harness AI responsibly, deliver measurable business outcomes, and build cultures where innovation thrives. We'd be honored to have your perspective at the table.

Would you be open to joining us on October 8th at 6:00pm at Bar La Grassa in Minneapolis?

Best,
Jake

EXAMPLE 2:
Hi Adam,

We've met with some of your team, and they suggested we connect on Windsurf and Devin. We're hosting a private executive dinner in on October 9th at 6:00pm at Elske in Chicago, bringing together a small group of executives to discuss the real impact of agentic AI in enterprises.

Given your leadership launching generative AI at Salesforce, your current role driving AI strategy at Altimetrik, and your forward-thinking work on governance with the World Economic Forum, I wanted to personally extend an invitation your way. Altimetrik's prior interest in Windsurf also makes this an especially timely conversation.

It will be an evening of candid discussion among peers shaping how AI translates into measurable business value. I'd be glad to have your voice at the table—can I save you a seat?

Best,
Jake

EXAMPLE 3:
Hi Ram,

We've met with some of your team, and they suggested we connect about Devin. We're hosting a private executive dinner on October 9th at 6:00pm at Elske in Chicago, bringing together a small group of executives to discuss the real impact of agentic AI in enterprises.

One of my colleagues mentioned your talk on GenAI for Process Improvement at Loyola, and I wanted to personally invite you as I think you'd be a perfect fit for this discussion.

Devin, the AI software engineer, has rolled out in production at Citi (American Banker: Citi Is Rolling Out Agentic AI To Its 40,000 Developers), Goldman Sachs (CNBC: Goldman Sachs is piloting its first autonomous coder in major AI milestone for Wall Street), and several of the largest financial services firms internationally. On average, banks see 6-12x efficiency gains on human engineering time with Devin.

EXAMPLE 1:
Hi Eric,

Congrats on being recognized on Fast Company's "World's Most Innovative Companies" list -- great to see your growth and success! I'm founding president @ Cognition (makers of Devin & recently acquired Windsurf). 

We have met with several directors and understand there are legacy migrations.. This prevents work on products like your forward thinking projects.

Devin, the AI software engineer, has rolled out in production at Citi (American Banker: Citi Is Rolling Out Agentic AI To Its 40,000 Developers), On average, banks see 6-12x efficiency gains on human engineering time with Devin. Curious if you have spoken to any of your previous colleagues at Citi about our success there?

BMO is the only big bank in North America that we aren't engaged with in some capacity. I would like to change this :)

Can we have our EAs coordinate time for a quick Zoom call to discuss this further?

Cheers,
Russell

EXAMPLE 2:
Hi Shamus,

Congrats on being a CIO of the Year Finalist. It's great to see your forward-thinking leadership and GenAI adoption across the org, highlighted by projects like ChatMFC. I'm founding president @ Cognition (makers of Devin & recently acquired Windsurf). 

I understand you have 70+ use cases of GenAI prioritized for deployment by the end of 2025. It looks like you are targeting a 3x return on these initiatives, and thought it would make sense to show how we are helping similar orgs achieve 6-12x improvements. 

Devin, the AI software engineer, has rolled out in production at Citi (American Banker: Citi Is Rolling Out Agentic AI To Its 40,000 Developers), Goldman Sachs (CNBC: Goldman Sachs is piloting its first autonomous coder in major AI milestone for Wall Street), and several of the largest financial services firms internationally. On average, banks see 6-12x efficiency gains on human engineering time with Devin.

Manulife is on a short list of Insurance providers in North America that we aren't engaged with in some capacity. I would like to change this :)

I would love the chance to meet in-person the next time I'm in the Toronto area. For now can we have our EAs coordinate time for a quick Zoom call to discuss this further?

Cheers,
Russell

EXAMPLE 3:
Hi Alexis,

It's been a bit since we last caught up - hope you are doing well! 

The Datadog team has recently started looking into Devin, our async agent, that is being used by organizations like Citi, Goldman, and Ramp and I wanted to keep you in the loop. 

We are working to align on a pilot with Simon's team — with Devin connecting workflows across Jira/Slack and handling time-intensive migrations. This week we're scoping a 1,000-endpoint migration to determine the best way Devin can accelerate and streamline the work.

A lot has happened in the last few months (Cognition merger, recent raise, updated roadmap) – Can 
we find some time to catch up and talk about how we are seeing Devin impact similar orgs and share what our strategy looks like for Datadog.
