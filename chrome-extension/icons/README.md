# Icons Placeholder

To complete the extension, you need to add three icon files:
- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)  
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

## Quick Option: Use Emoji
1. Open this in browser: https://emojipedia.org/ghost/
2. Take screenshots of the ghost emoji at different sizes
3. Save as PNG files with the names above

## Better Option: Design Custom Icons
1. Use Figma, Canva, or similar tool
2. Create a "G" logo with purple gradient (#667eea to #764ba2)
3. Export at 16x16, 48x48, and 128x128 sizes

## Temporary Workaround
The extension will still work without icons, but Chrome will show a default placeholder.
